# miniDLNA for Home Assistant (HA)

## Description

miniDLNA is a lightweight media (audio, pictures & video) server, which aims to be fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP-AV clients.

This local app (HA-addon) provides a container for Home Assistant with miniDLNA. Based on work from [Drize](https://github.com/drize) & [Cavaliere78](https://github.com/cavaliere78), the former addon was updated to the latest HA approach for local apps, including apparmor etc. Current minidlna-version can be checked in the [alpine package details](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86/minidlna).

## Bugs
HA generates a webui-button automatically, but this -very minimal- interface doesn't work (yet). You'll discover your server with [DLNA Digital Media Server](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dlna_dms/) or in the [Media browser](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/media_browser).

Please note [bugs](https://sourceforge.net/p/minidlna/bugs/) related to the [miniDLNA project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/files/minidlna) (ReadyMedia) can be reported at its [projectpage](https://sourceforge.net/p/minidlna/bugs/) on sourceforge.
